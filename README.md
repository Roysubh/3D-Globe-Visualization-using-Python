# 3D-Globe-Visualization-using-Python

Overview:
This project demonstrates how to create a 3D visualization of the globe using the Basemap toolkit in Python, along with a space-themed background image. The visualization is generated through a series of frames that are then compiled into a high-resolution GIF.

Prerequisites:
Ensure you have Python installed, along with the following libraries
1. matplotlib
2. numpy
3. imageio.v2
4. basemap
5. matplotlib.pyplot
6. numpy
7. os
8. datetime

Steps:
1. Set Up the Environment
Create a directory where the output images will be saved. In this case, it's set to D:/Python/Globe_3_PNG/.

2. Import Required Libraries
The code imports essential libraries:

3. Initialize the Figure
Set up the figure for plotting with a higher DPI (dots per inch) to enhance the quality of the output images.

4. Define Viewing Angles
Set the latitude and longitude viewing angles for the globe's rotation.

5. Initial Basemap Setup
Configure the Basemap using the orthographic projection and define the initial coordinates.

6. Load Background Image
Load a space-themed background image to enhance the visualization. Ensure the image path is correct.

7. Generate Frames for the Globe
Loop through the defined latitude and longitude vectors to create a rotating effect.
Clear the axis for each new frame and redraw the globe with the bluemarble function.
Save each frame as a high-resolution PNG image.

9. Create GIF from Saved Images
After generating all frames, read the images and compile them into a GIF.
Save the GIF to your working directory.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how to create a visually appealing 3D representation of the globe using Python. By following these steps, you can replicate similar visualizations or modify the parameters for different viewing angles and background images.

Optional:
Background Image
Ensure you have a suitable background image for the space theme. You can find high-quality images on websites like Unsplash or Pexels.
